TODO
-----

- Make KioFuse multithreaded so that multiple userspace apps can access remote files at the same time. Currently, if a directory takes a long time to be accessed (simulated by a sleep(20) call in ListJobHelper::receiveEntries), all new requests to kioFuseReadDir are stalled.

- Fix CMakeLists.txt so that FUSE is only linked to kiofuse.h and not to all the other source files. Currently, the following warning appears for the other files:
        c++: -lfuse: linker input file unused because linking not done
 
- Implement more filesystem operations in kiofuseops.h

- Make KIO aware of KioFuse mountpoints so that it doesn't use them, but uses KIO slaves directly. Libfusi (http://www.scheinwelt.at/~norbertf/devel/fusi) would come in handy for keeping track of mountpoints and converting local paths <---> remote paths.

- Integrate KioFuse into the KNetAttach GUI.

- write documentation
