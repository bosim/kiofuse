Introduction
-------------

KioFuse allows you to mount remote directories into the root hierarchy of your local system, thereby exposing KIO filesystems to POSIX-compliant applications: Firefox, OpenOffice, GNOME apps, shell utilities and more. Another important advantage of KioFuse is that it allows you to arrange the hierarchy of *all* your files (local or remote) in whichever way makes sense to you (just like symliks).

It works by acting as a bridge between the KIO filesystem design and FUSE, a program to mount user-space filesystems.  For information about FUSE, see http://fuse.sourceforge.net .
